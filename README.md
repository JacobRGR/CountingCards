## CountingCards
Trying to count cards via Machine Learning


# Q. What is this?
A. Hell if I know. I was eating supper and looking at a deck of cards when I thought to myself, "*Imagine all the buzzwords I could use if I made something that used Augmented Reality Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to recognize cards and count your score, despite how easy counting cards generally is.*"
